# Green Leaf and the Garbage Truck
A game made for Ludum Dare 49

This repo is a mess, because the game was made in 3 days. I will refactor it to make it more tidy, some day.

## Plot:

Green Leaf, the ecology superhero, has spotted an enviromental menace: an unstable garbage truck is running at crazy speed down the highway, with its back door open! Help Green Leaf collect the items falling down the truck, without putting them in the wrong box and making a mess!

## Instructions:

Move with WASD or arrow keys
Switch container with 123 or JKL

Collect the trash with the matching container

Don't let the trash fall off the screen!
